# AI Rules for qa-toolsmith

QA Toolsmith (MVP) is an open-source, lightweight web app that standardizes testersâ€™ daily work. It includes email/password auth with admin/user roles, defect report templates with quick copy/export to Markdown, an Exploration Charter (timer, tags, Markdown export), and a minimal Knowledge Base (CRUD, tags, search). Built-in generators/validators produce synthetic test data for PL/DE/AT (incl. IBAN DE/AT). An optional AI assistant can polish content with a per-user daily limit and a safe manual fallback. The MVP ships with unit and E2E tests plus a CI/CD pipeline, and deliberately excludes external integrations and file uploads to keep deployment simple and secure.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
