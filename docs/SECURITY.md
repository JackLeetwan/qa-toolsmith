- ✅ Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- ✅ Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- ✅ Use HTTPS everywhere

### Infrastructure

- ✅ Cloudflare security features enabled (WAF, DDoS protection)
- ✅ All secrets stored in secure vaults (not in code/config files)
- ✅ Access logs monitored regularly
- ✅ Security updates applied promptly

### Development

- ✅ Code reviews required for all changes
- ✅ Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Security testing as part of testing suite
