# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: GET `/health`

## 1. Endpoint Overview

The GET `/health` endpoint serves as a simple application health check mechanism, providing information about system availability and readiness. It is required by the PRD (Product Requirements Document) for basic functionality tests (smoke checks).

## 2. Request Details

- HTTP Method: GET
- URL Structure: `/health`
- Parameters: None
- Headers: Standard HTTP headers
- Request Body: None (GET endpoint)

## 3. Types Used

```typescript
export interface HealthDTO {
  status: "ok";
}
```

This type is already defined in the `src/types/types.ts` file.

## 4. Response Details

- Status Code: 200 OK for successful response
- Content-Type: application/json
- Response Body:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## 5. Data Flow

1. Application receives a GET request to the `/health` endpoint
2. System checks basic application readiness
3. System returns a response with status code 200 and JSON `{ "status": "ok" }`

This endpoint does not require database access or interaction with external services.

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: The endpoint should be publicly available without authentication to enable monitoring by external systems (e.g., Kubernetes, load balancers)
- **Authorization**: Not required
- **Data Validation**: Not applicable (no input data)
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic request rate limiting can be considered, but the endpoint should handle frequent queries from monitoring systems

## 7. Error Handling

- 500 Internal Server Error - in case of internal application issues
  ```json
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "internal_server_error",
      "message": "An unexpected server error occurred"
    }
  }
  ```

## 8. Performance Considerations

- Endpoint should be fast and lightweight, with minimal system load
- Additional operations that could delay the response should be avoided
- A caching mechanism for frequent queries can be considered (e.g., with TTL = 5s)

## 9. Implementation Steps

1. Create file `/src/pages/api/health.ts` with the endpoint implementation:

```typescript
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";
import type { HealthDTO } from "../../types/types";

export const prerender = false;

export const GET: APIRoute = async () => {
  // Simple implementation without additional checks
  const health: HealthDTO = { status: "ok" };

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(health), {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  });
};
```

2. Create health service (optional) in `/src/lib/services/health.service.ts`:

```typescript
import type { HealthDTO } from "../../types/types";

export class HealthService {
  /**
   * Checks application health status
   * @returns Application health status
   */
  static getHealth(): HealthDTO {
    // More complex checks can be added in the future
    return { status: "ok" };
  }
}
```

3. Update endpoint to use the service (optional):

```typescript
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";
import { HealthService } from "../../lib/services/health.service";

export const prerender = false;

export const GET: APIRoute = async () => {
  try {
    const health = HealthService.getHealth();

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(health), {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Health check failed:", error);

    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        error: {
          code: "internal_server_error",
          message: "An unexpected server error occurred",
        },
      }),
      {
        status: 500,
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
      },
    );
  }
};
```

4. Add documentation for the endpoint in README or other appropriate location

5. Add health check to CI/CD configuration and development environments

6. Implement monitoring (optional) - set up alerts for when the `/health` endpoint starts returning errors
